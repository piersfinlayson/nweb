Legal License side step
As it is simple C systems programming code that any genius C programmer (like me :-) would write in a similar way, I gave it away as sample code and not needing a legal license to use, reuse or anything else you like.   This nicely avoids any legal issues because even IBMers can give away obvious sample code - once you understand all the public domain principles.
